Incognito Direct Messages
-------------------------

`draft` `optional` [`depends:16`](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/16.md) [`depends:19`](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/19.md) `author:antonleviathan` `author:bmewj` `author:styppo`

This NIP defines a scheme for establishing disposable identity key pairs which can be used to exchange DMs while preventing public inbox peeking. Clients can either abstract away this behavior and present incognito messages as regular DMs, or as a special type of message.

The scheme consists of three elements:

1. An invite code sent in regular DMs to invite a counterparty to establish a private DM conversation,
2. A `kind: 1031` event for the private DM messages, and
3. A `nip31` property stored on the user's profile to keep track of their disposable identities.

## Motivation

There is an ongoing discussion regarding NIP-04 and how its privacy problems can be remediated.

To achieve state of the art private messaging on Nostr, we'd have to implement a schema leveraged by existing solutions such as XMPP, Matrix, Signal, Sphinx, or a number of other sophisticated private message protocols on Nostr, which we believe to not be in the spirit of Nostr, and which are complex to implement. For true private messages, users should go somewhere else for the time being.

With that being said, we can make an effort to improve the state of NIP-04 today.

## General flow

Bob wants to send incognito messages to Alice.

### 1. Generate disposable identities

Bob generates two new disposable identities: 
* `Bob'` (`pkBob'` & `skBob'`)
* `Bob''` (`pkBob''` & `skBob''`).

### 2. Send invitation to Alice

Bob publishes the following `kind: 4` event:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "pubkey": <pkBob'>, // This identity is not tied to `Bob`
  "kind": 4,
  "created_at": 12345678,
  "tags": [
    ["p", <pkAlice>]
  ],
  "content": <ciphertext>
}
```

The `<ciphertext>` contains the following:

> Someone wants to start an incognito conversation with you.
> Your client may not support this behavior. You can find
> a list of clients here who support incognito messaging:
> https://nostrincognito.com/clients
>
>
> nostr:ninvite1qqs0zfs7ncrcnnyfdy3kecyck4xwaaxakrglfs3xn6nvpn408wu84eczypyf43vrlscvl0hqp9wawdhvgergl25trplrz876vf5ufcvzsnkscq6q2kkjulayz0assc4sccv3rxlysh9yga9gtk8eaj4mynjkw8anh7pv5t5czsz7fcy4jyguvnr8qny7uc27fhp6l28aksrsh3qngu9mx8cpz4mhxue69uhk2er9dchxummnw3ezumrpdejqd8c0mr

The message should include a human-friendly text for clients that don't support incognito messages. This preserves backwards compatibility and improves the user experience.

Clients who support incognito messages should look for the presence of an `nostr:ninvite...` bech32-encoded entity.

The invite code contains the following:
1. `author`: `pkBob` Bob's well known identity,
3. `convKey`: `pkBob''` The disposable identity Bob will be using to send Alice incognito messages (conversation key),
4. `sig`: `sigBob` A signature proving Bob is the real originator of the invite, and
5. `relay` The trusted relay where Alice should subscribe to receive Bob's incognito messages (optional).

### 3. Send an incognito message

Once Bob has sent his invitation to Alice he can publish incognito messages using his new disposable identity `pkBob''` to a relay he trusts.

To send a message he first constructs a regular DM event:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "pubkey": <pkBob>,
  "kind": 4,
  "created_at": 12345678,
  "tags": [
    ["p", <pkAlice>]  
  ],
  "content": <ciphertext>,
  "sig": <sig>
}
```

Next, he takes the event JSON, encrypts it using `skBob` and `pkAlice` and wraps it in a `kind: 1031` incognito DM using his `pkBob''` pubkey.

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "pubkey": <pkBob''>,
  "kind": 1031,
  "created_at": 12345678,
  "tags": [],
  "content": <encrypted JSON of regular DM>,
  "sig": <sig>
}
```

On Alice's side, her client can subscribe to `kind: 1031` events from `pkBob''` on Bob's trusted relay. Upon receipt of an event, the client can decrypt the `.content` and unwrap the regular DM from Bob and present it to Alice. For added privacy, the individuals could choose to use private relays.

## The invite code

```
nostr:ninvite1qqs0zfs7ncrcnnyfdy3kecyck4xwaaxakrglfs3xn6nvpn408wu84eczypyf43vrlscvl0hqp9wawdhvgergl25trplrz876vf5ufcvzsnkscq6q2kkjulayz0assc4sccv3rxlysh9yga9gtk8eaj4mynjkw8anh7pv5t5czsz7fcy4jyguvnr8qny7uc27fhp6l28aksrsh3qngu9mx8cpz4mhxue69uhk2er9dchxummnw3ezumrpdejqd8c0mr
```

The invite code is a bech32-encoded entity with prefix `ninvite` containing a TLV (type, length, value) array as outlined in [NIP-19](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/19.md).

For `ninvite`, the following `TLV` types are used:

- `0`: `special`
    - for `ninvite` it will be the 32 bytes of the conversation pubkey (e.g. `pkBob''`)
- `1`: `relay`
  - for `ninvite` it represents the recommended trusted relay on which to find Bob's messages
- `2`: `author`
  - for `ninvite`, the 32 bytes of the well-known author of the event (e.g. `pkBob`)
- `3`: `kind`
  - not used
- `4`: `sig` *(new type)*
  - for `ninvite`, the 64 bytes of the invite signature

See [nostr-incognito](https://github.com/bmewj/nostr-incognito/blob/master/src/index.ts) for a reference implementation of invite code parsing/writing.

### The `relay` value
The `relay` is specified by `Bob` and is the relay he is going to post messages to for this conversation. This is an improvement over NIP-59 where the sender specifies the relay where they are listening for messages, since the counterparty might not be able to write to that relay.

`Alice` may notify `Bob` in subsequent messages what relay she will post her messages to, with her disposable identity `Alice'`


### The `sig` value
The invite code proves that Bob (`Bob`) is the originator of the message, that `Alice` is the intended recipient of these messages, and that `pkBob''` is the new identity that `Bob` will be using to communicate with `Alice` going forward. 

The signature is obtained by creating and signing the following throwaway event:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "pubkey": <pkBob>, // 'author'
  "kind": 0,
  "created_at": 0, // Must be 0
  "tags": [
    ["p", <pkAlice>], // 'recipient'
    ["p", <pkBob''>]  // 'conversation id'
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": <sig>
}
```

In other words, it's a signature of `[0, <pkBob>, 0, 0, [["p", <pkAlice>], ["p", <pkBob''>]], ""]`.

On receipt, Alice can reconstruct an identical event by substituting in her own pubkey and the values from the invite code, allowing her to verify the signature.


## Disposable Identity Derivation
To manage the creation of disposable entities, hierarchical deterministic derivation is used (based on [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032/derivation.png)). BIP-32 supports `secp256k1` out of the box, thus it lends itself perfectly towards generating disposable identities within the context of nostr.

Two pieces of state need to be tracked to generate new identities:
- `seed`: 256 bits of entropy, and
- `counter`: an integer counter storing the number of conversations already generated.

`seed` should be stored, and `counter` can be determined by querying relays for open conversations. See below.

### Starting a new conversation
For each new private conversation a user wants to open, for example `Bob` sending messages to `Alice`, `Bob` must generate two identities: 
* one to use for sending the invite message (`Bob'`), and 
* one to use for all subsequent messages (`Bob''`).

Given the `counter` and `seed`, the two new disposable identities are derived using the following derivation paths:

`pkBob' ` = `m/44'/0'/<counter>'/0/0`
`pkBob''` = `m/44'/0'/<counter>'/0/1`

Once generated, the client should increment their `counter`.

For illustrative purposes here is what the first 3 derivation steps would look like:
```
m/44/0'/0/0/0
m/44/0'/0/0/1
    
m/44/0'/1/0/0
m/44/0'/1/0/1
    
m/44/0'/2/0/0
m/44/0'/2/0/1
```


### Fetching the seed
The `seed` is generated by the user once for the lifetime of their account. In theory, the user's nostr private key could be used as the seed, but since `window.nostr` and physical signing devices prevent direct access to private keys, it is currently impractical to do this. 

Clients should check the user's `kind: 0` profile for the presence of a `nip31` field, which stores the user's `seed`.

If not present, the client can run the user through a setup flow to generate a new `seed` and commit it to their profile.

To commit it to their profile, the 32 byte `seed` should be converted to hex and encrypted using NIP-04 encryption to the user's private key.

While it is typically not safe to use private keys in unsecure environments like a client, or otherwise, the content of the messages is encrypted using the primary keypairs of the users.

### Fetching open conversations
In order to fetch all open conversations the client has to fetch all invites that the user has sent as well as all invites that the user has received.

Finding received invites is simple as they are embedded in regular DMs to the user's pubkey.

Finding sent invites however requires subscribing to an increasing set of disposable identities:

```
m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
m/44'/0'/1'/0/0
m/44'/0'/2'/0/0
m/44'/0'/3'/0/0
m/44'/0'/4'/0/0
...
```

For each disposable identity that has been used, the client should receive one invite per identity. The invite message will have the well-known recipient listed as a `p` tag.

Doing this once the client will be able to determine the `counter` and all open conversations.

## Potential Improvements

### Reactions, Boosts, and Rich Content

Since incognito DMs are simply wrappers around `kind: 4` events, they can equally wrap `kind: 7` reactions and `kind: 6` boosts to support more rich content types within DM conversations.

Furthermore, regular `kind: 1` text notes can be used instead of DMs since encryption is already taken care of by the wrapper event.

This can be generalized to allow any event kinds to be published in private conversations.

### Private Group Chats
Private conversations of this kind can easily be extended to support multiple recipients by encrypting message content with a symmetric key `key` followed by encrypting the `key` once for every recipient (a la Signal's client-side fanout).

### Ratcheting
It would be possible to adjust the implementation to generate a new incognito identity for each subsequent message. This poses some complexity and privacy implications as the user exposes information when requesting the replaceable events which are used to maintain the state of known conversations.

Removing the 2 identity limit (on the identity index used for hd derivation) would allow us to generate as many identities per conversation as we like, but makes state management trickier as we have to store an additional counter, or derive keys until we find matching messages, which is flakey, computationally demanding and congests the network.

### Increasing the identity set by querying randomly selected messages from the relay
When the client requests messages, we could explore coming up with a way to request more messages than we are interested in, in order to make it harder for the relay to deduce which messages are relevant to us. 

### Sharing extended pubkeys with trusted relays
The obvious drawback of using disposable identities is that paid relays who function by whitelisting paying users won't recognize their disposable identities. This could be mitigated in future by sharing the extended pubkey of a user's seed with their trusted relay, enabling the relay to blanket whitelist all of the user's disposable identities.

## Definitions

- `invite` A regular NIP-04 message that contains an invitation to start an incognito conversation.
- `identity` A standard nostr keypair. We make a distinction between "well known" `identities` and "disposable" `identities`, the former being a keypair that someone is known by, and the latter being new identities which are not visibly linked to a "well known" identity, and as such, are anonymous.
- `[name]`: A public keypair identifying the person, and is also used as reference to the actor, for example `Bob` or `Alice`
- `sk[name]` A secret key that belongs to a person
- `pk[name]` A public key that belongs to a person
- `[key][name]'`: A key which is disposable. For example, the "well known" npub key of Bob would be `pkBob`, the first disposable identity we generate `pkBob'` and the second disposable identity `pkBob''`.
